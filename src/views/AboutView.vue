        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>Welcome to ThandoNaturals, where love for natural hair meets empowerment. 
           Founded in South Africa by Thandeka and Ntando, our name "Thando" symbolizes 
           love—a love for natural hair and a commitment to empowering our community.
           <br><br>
           Inspired by a shared passion and the realization that many lacked resources 
           and knowledge to care for their natural hair, we set out to make a difference. 
           Our mission is simple: provide high-quality, ethically sourced products at accessible
           prices, ensuring everyone can embrace their roots with pride.
           <br><br>
           Crafted with care and consideration for diverse needs, our formulations celebrate the 
           beauty of African hair. From lush landscapes to global stages, ThandoNaturals is redefining 
           beauty standards and empowering self-expression.
           <br><br>
           Join us on this journey of love, authenticity, and empowerment. Together, let's celebrate the 
           beauty of natural hair and make a difference—one curl at a time.
           <br><br>
           Welcome to the ThandoNaturals family.
           <br><br>
           With love and curls,
           <br><br>
           Thandeka & Ntando.
